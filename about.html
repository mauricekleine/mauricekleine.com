      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I'm an AI engineer and indie maker based in Amsterdam. My background
        isn't a straight line—I started studying psychology, but switched to
        tech when I realized I wanted something more concrete and impactful.
        What began as a late start in coding turned into 14+ years of building
        software across startups and scale-ups.
      </p>
      <p>
        While at university, I built a logistics system out of frustration with
        how data was handled at my part-time job. Six years later, I sold it—my
        first small but proud exit. From there, I wore many hats: frontend
        engineer, backend engineer, product owner, and engineering manager
        leading teams of developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2023, I founded Subthread where we built dozens of AI-powered
        products—from chatbots to recruitment pipelines to consumer apps. That
        experience showed me how powerful AI can be for businesses of all sizes,
        not just tech companies. Now I help SMEs unlock time and efficiency by
        building AI-powered automations that streamline internal workflows.
      </p>

      <h2>What I Build</h2>
      <p>
        I treat life as a series of experiments. The same applies to building
        products—I ship small internet products, learn from them, and keep
        iterating. Even difficult experiments are worth the effort as long as
        you keep learning.
      </p>
      <p>Current projects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://getmockly.com">Mockly</a> - A tool for creating
          realistic chat mockups. Empowers marketers, creators, and filmmakers
          to generate conversations for 15+ messaging platforms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://onesixtyeight.life">ONESIXTYEIGHT</a> - Helping
          people get more out of their 168 hours each week, starting with a
          functional mushroom blend for focus without the crash.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://nonobench.com">NonoBench</a> - A benchmark for
          evaluating how well LLMs solve Nonogram puzzles. Interactive results,
          visualizations, and leaderboards for AI reasoning capabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/mauricekleine/chief">Chief</a> - A CLI
          tool that orchestrates autonomous AI coding agents using the "Ralph
          Wiggum methodology"—a five-phase approach to AI-assisted development.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Community</h2>
      <p>
        I run <a href="https://hackadam.nl">Hackadam</a>, a monthly meetup in
        Amsterdam for indie makers, coders, designers, and hardware hackers who
        build their own apps and startups. We meet, share what we're working on,
        have lunch together, do demos, and hang out. It's part of the broader
        HACKA* Network.
      </p>
      <p>
        Building alone can be isolating. Having a community of people who
        understand the journey—the wins and the failures—makes the process more
        sustainable and enjoyable.
      </p>

      <h2>Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        My main goal is to have the biggest comfort zone possible by
        continuously pushing boundaries. Growth comes from stepping outside your
        comfort zone, but you need a safe base to return to. Travel, building
        products, and community all expand that zone.
      </p>
      <p>
        I try to observe without judging and extract what aligns with my values.
        Learning develops new perspectives, not just new information. Any
        experiment is worth the effort as long as you keep learning—just because
        an experiment didn't result in a happier life doesn't mean it failed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The real value of technology lies in solving everyday problems for real
        people. That's what keeps me building.
      </p>
