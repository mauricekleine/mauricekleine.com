      "summary": "I help SMEs unlock time and efficiency by building AI-powered automations that streamline internal workflows and processes.",
      "background": "My background isn't a straight line. I started out studying psychology, but switched to technology when I realized I wanted something more concrete and impactful. What began as a late start in coding quickly turned into a passion for building systems that make life and business run smoother.",
      "earlyCareer": "While at university, I built a logistics system out of frustration with how data was handled at my part-time job. Six years later, I sold it, my first (small but proud) exit.",
      "experience": "From there, I worked across startups and scale-ups, wearing many hats: frontend engineer, backend engineer, product owner, and eventually engineering manager leading teams of developers.",
      "philosophy": "Along the way, I learned one core truth: the real value of technology lies in solving everyday problems for real people.",
      "recentWork": "In 2023, I founded Subthread, where we built dozens of AI-powered products ranging from chatbots to recruitment pipelines to consumer apps. That experience opened my eyes to just how powerful AI can be for businesses of all sizes, not just tech companies.",
      "callToAction": "Curious about how AI could work in your business? Feel free to send me a DM, I'd love to explore ideas with you."
